## Routing and Layout

- Routes are defined in `src/App.tsx` using `ROUTES` from `utils/constants.ts`.
- Use `components/auth/ProtectedRoute` to guard authenticated pages.
- Page layout should use `components/layout/SidebarLayout` which renders the nav, header, and main content.
- Sidebar icons should be Heroicons (outline) and passed as components via the `navItems` list.
- For navigation links, use `NavLink` to get active state styling.
